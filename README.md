# PureData_Round
A pure data patch, made to be used with Bela.

Analog in for volume control. Second track is audible between .3 - 1, Third track is audible between .6-1.

Digital in controls playback speed. When receiving signal the playback speed is slowed down, when signal is no longer being received playback speed increases until it reaches the original playback speed.

Two analog outs for LED display. Brightness of LEDS corresponds with second and third tracks' volumes.
